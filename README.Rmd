## Abstract

The organism that's understudy is
Merlin (*Falco columbarius*), which is a small, dashing falcon that breeds
throughout the northern forests and prairies of North America, Europe, and Asia.
My question is to confirm if there really is a pattern of more Merlins nesting
in urban areas. This question will be answered with the Species Distribution
Model. This is a quantitative tool used by many ecologists which helps one find
a relationship between a variable and probability of occurrence. EBird database
will be used to obtain data for this project. My variables will consist of
either "present" or "absent" at a given location. Exploratory data analysis
will be used since it permits us to examine the data without making any
assumptions. A prediction that can be made based on our knowledge on Merlins is
that, if an area is too industrialized and consist of many trees then not many
Merlins will be present, since they require open areas to hunt. A map with
predicted abundance, will allow us to launch other projects regarding Merlins
and help us study them even better because we will have a better understanding
of where they are and which areas they prefer to nest in.

## Introduction

![](images/paste-2D52FEDB.png)

-   Organism of interest is Merlin which is a small species of falcon from the Northern Hemisphere

-   The question studied here is "are there are more Merlins nesting in urban areas when compared to rural areas"?

-   One hypothesis made was if a particular area consist of innumerable trees and buildings then there will not be many Merlins present. Merlins require open areas to hunt.

-   To test this hypothesis, a map was created showcasing the abundance of
    Merlins in the region of Canada and United States of America

## Methods

-   This project was created through RStudio.

-   Packages like "mapproj", "sf", "rnaturalearth", "rlang", "maps", "rnaturalearthdata" were installed which allowed me to come up with my final product.

-   The data was obtained from the "Ebird database", which is what this picture displays, the place where I downloaded my files.

## Results

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(auk)
library(sf)
library(rnaturalearth)

ebd <- read_ebd("Data/ebd_filtered_merlin.txt")
smp <- read_sampling("Data/edaproj_filtered_smp.txt")


# Making a map  -----------------------------------------------------------
ebd_sf <- st_as_sf(ebd, coords=c("longitude","latitude"), crs = 4326)
smp_sf <- st_as_sf(smp, coords=c("longitude","latitude"), crs = 4326)

states <- 
  ne_states(
    country = c("Canada", "United States of America"), 
    returnclass = "sf"
  ) %>%
  print()

states %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_sf() +
  geom_sf(data = smp_sf, alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_sf(data = ebd_sf, color = "green") +
  coord_sf(xlim = c(-115,-92), ylim = c(41, 55.5))
```

-   This coding allowed me to create my map, showing Merlin abundance.

-   Black dots are spots where people looked for birds

-   Green dots are the spots where the birds were founded

-   Not only do we want to know where Merlins are but we also must be aware of the places they are not present.

-   A "complete checklist" is a checklist with all species documented, where species not observed are put in as "absent". This allows us to see where Merlins are not present.

-   The regions where green dots are clumped are cities which are comprised of more Conifers when compared to open land which have shrubs and grasses and not a lot of conifer trees.

-   A lot of black means there weren't many Merlins observed, which is what is shown in the South area of the map.

## Discussion

-   The green dots are clumped where cities are present. There are more Conifers trees in the cities. More small birds take shelter in the Conifers. Merlins prey on small birds like Horned Larks, House Sparrows, Pigeons.

-   Some of the different hypotheses that I came up with were called nest availability hypothesis, food availability hypothesis and Merlins avoiding human hypothesis.

    -   Nest availability hypothesis sates that there will be more nests in the cities because there would be more Conifers present.

    -   Food availability hypothesis present the concept that there will be more Merlins observed in cities because there are more smaller birds present.

    -   Merlins avoiding humans hypothesis says that if an area is too populated, not many Merlins will be found due to innumerable buildings and high noise level.

-   To test all of these hypotheses, more data is needed. Data about people and vegetation. Try to see if there any patterns between variables like trees and Merlins and people.

-   Step 1 of the project is completed which was to get a map showing Merlin abundance. The map serves as a tool to do more investigation on Merlins.

    -   This will help us launch other projects like studying Merlin behavior or fitness studies. Fitness studies would compare the fitness of urban Merlins to non-urban Merlins and see how different environments impact these birds.

Ask him about the code in the results section and that you don't have any paras

Ask him if that is what you should talk about in your discussion

Ask him if it would be a good idea to draw that hypothesis diagram

Citations ok? Tips/tricks to do good.
